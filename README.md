# PDF-Editor (with GUI) in Python + customtkinter

Welcome to one of my bigger python projects which I still did as a beginner. 

It is not finished, but planned for the future. At the moment only the PDF-Merger works.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is currently under construction, so that anyone interested can test it out. Therefore I am going to change the structure of the repo.

> The goal is to dockerise every version of the calculator so it will run on your machine too 👍
